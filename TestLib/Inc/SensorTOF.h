 * @brief          : This library file handles communication with a Time-of-Flight (TOF) sensor.
 *                    Currently adapted to the VL53LOX sensor.
 *                    The library supports both single-shot and continuous measurement modes.
 *                    Configuration is managed via the appropriate register settings for the sensor.
 * @date           : April 2025
 ******************************************************************************


 ******************************************************************************
 * This code and the register addresses are based on the official API, which can be found here:

 ******************************************************************************
 * Sensor Configuration:
 * - Supports the VL53LOX sensor via I2C communication.
 * - Defines various operating modes such as high accuracy, long range, and high speed.
 * - Allows for configuration of measurement profiles and VCSEL periods.
 * - Provides functions to initialize, configure, and read measurements from the sensor.
 *
 * Macros:
 * - Calculation of macro periods and VCSEL periods.
 * - Handling of I2C communication for sensor register access.
 * 
 * Structures:
 * - The library includes structures for handling TOF sensor settings and configuration,
 *   such as address, I2C instance, ranging profiles, and measured range.
 * 
 * Functionality:
 * - Initialize TOF sensor with specified settings (address, I2C, mode, range).
 * - Configure the sensor for different measurement modes (e.g., single or continuous).
 * - Retrieve distance measurements from the sensor.
 * 
 * Supported modes:
 * - Default mode, high accuracy mode, high-speed mode, and long-range mode.
 * - Customizable for future sensors as per the interface and register mappings.
